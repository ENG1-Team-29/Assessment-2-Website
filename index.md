In an alternative Universe, the University of York is built around a very large lake,
on which you can find a number of colleges. Ships are the only manner of transport to
go from college to college or building to building; some colleges may be friendly to
each other, others may be hostile to each other.

You are a privateer with allegiance to one College. You sail the great Lake of York on
quests and adventures, and may choose to attack ships of other Colleges, try to sack
Colleges, etc. Gameplay ends when the player is defeated in some way, or when the
player has achieved the gameâ€™s objective.
