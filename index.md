Our product is a top down pirate simulator set in an alternate modern day York.
The University campus lake has flooded Heslington! The colleges have provided a safe haven for students,
in return for help conquering the lake! You must help your college defeat other colleges, or meet your demise!

The Biology lab has recently had a breakout of a mutated squid, so sail the lake with caution.
The moon has recently been orbiting the planet dangerously close, so the lake has been getting deadlier,
including bizzare weather phenomenons. Shard's of the moons have splashed into the lake and students have been reporting
strange glowing bubbles that transforms ships temporarily. Will you discover the next weird occurence?
