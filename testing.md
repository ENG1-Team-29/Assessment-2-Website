# Testing
[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/actions/workflows/gradle.yml){:target="_blank"}
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=D2BMT48XY9)](https://codecov.io/gh/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2)

## Unit Testing
Unit tests are run with github actions whenever a change is made to the master branch or when a pull request is made. Continuous Integration testing can be found on the github actions page: [Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/actions/workflows/gradle.yml){:target="_blank"} <br />
By entering one of the workflow runs, you will see the test results such as the example below:

[![Example Unit Test Results](/img/ci-example.png)](https://github.com/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/runs/6103544664?check_suite_focus=true){:target="_blank"}

The unit testing code itself is located in the [src/test/java](https://github.com/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/tree/master/core/src/test/java/io/github/annabeths){:target="_blank"} source folder.

## Code Coverage
During development of the game, we used code coverage reports to inspect what code hasn't been tested yet. We used the inbuilt code coverage tools found in Eclipse and IntelliJ but have since moved to [CodeCov.io](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ENG1-Team-29/Assessment-2/){:target="_blank"} to have automated coverage reporting on our repository. Codecov analyses coverage reports generated by the JaCoCo plugin. From this analysis, it generates a graph as seen below along with a line by line breakdown of what has and hasn't been tested. The coverage percentage can then be displayed in a badge as seen above.
